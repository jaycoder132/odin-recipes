        <h1>The Heart Behind The Recipes</h1>
        <p> Filipino cuisine is more than food. It is history, memory and identity.</p>
        <p>Every simmering stew recalls rainy afternoons at home.
            Every garlic aroma smells like birthdays and gatherings.
            Every bowl reminds us of where we came from.</p>
        <p>We preserve these dishes because if we forget them,
            we forget the stories that raised us.</p>

                <h2>Why we Cook</h2>
                <p>Cooking is storytelling. A recipe is a chapter and every dish
                    has one.</p>

                <p>Adobo, Sinigang and Tinola. These are not just meals.
                    They're pieces of home served on a plate.</p>
