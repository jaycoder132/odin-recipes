        <p><strong>Beef Kare-Kare</strong> is a traditional Filipino stew made rich and creamy with peanut sauce. 
           It is often served during special occasions and gatherings because of its luxurious and flavorful taste. 
           The tender beef combined with vegetables and peanut gravy creates a comforting dish that stands out in Filipino cuisine.</p>
        <p>The unique flavor of Kare-Kare comes from its blend of roasted peanuts, annatto coloring, and slow-cooked meat. 
           It is usually paired with <em>bagoong</em> (shrimp paste), which provides a salty contrast that enhances the dish even more. 
           Kare-Kare is a favorite for those who love thick, savory sauces with deep flavors.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Follow for Cooking</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the beef in a pot, add 4-5 cups of water, and boil for 1-1.5 hours or until the meat becomes tender. 
                You may use a pressure cooker to reduce cooking time.</li>
            <li>When tender, remove the meat from the broth and set aside. Reserve the broth as the soup base.</li>
            <li>In a separate pan, sauté garlic and onion for 2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked beef to the pan and mix gently.</li>
            <li>Pour about 2 cups of the reserved broth into the pan and stir in the annatto powder to give the sauce its orange color.</li>
            <li>Add the peanut butter and stir well until fully dissolved and the sauce becomes thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>Add the banana blossoms, eggplant, and string beans. Simmer for 5-7 minutes until vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Add the bok choy and cook for another 1-2 minutes until wilted.</li>
