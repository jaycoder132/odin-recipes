        </figure>
        <p><strong>Chicken Tinola</strong> is a classic Filipino soup that is light, comforting, and full of natural flavors. 
           The dish features chicken cooked in a ginger-flavored broth with vegetables such as green papaya or chayote and chili 
           leaves (or moringa leaves). Its soothing taste makes it perfect for rainy days, light lunches, or as a starter for family meals.</p>
        <p>What makes Tinola special is its simplicity and healthiness. The ginger and garlic give the soup warmth and aroma, 
           while the chicken provides protein, making it both nutritious and easy to prepare. It is also flexible, allowing different 
           vegetables based on availability, while still maintaining its signature taste.</p>
