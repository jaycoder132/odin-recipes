        <p><strong>Pork Sinigang</strong> is a classic Filipino sour soup known for its refreshing and comforting flavor, 
           especially on rainy days. The dish uses pork simmered with vegetables in a tamarind-based broth, giving it its 
           signature tang. It is a staple in many Filipino homes and is loved for its balance of savory, sour, and fresh tastes.</p>
        <p>This dish is also flexible. Different vegetables and meats can be substituted depending on availability. 
           It is popular among busy cooks because it is simple, delicious, and nutritious, making it a great everyday meal 
           or a comforting bowl after a long day.</p>
