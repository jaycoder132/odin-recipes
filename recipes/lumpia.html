        <p><strong>Pork Lumpia</strong> is a Filipino fried spring roll known for its crispy wrapper and savory filling. 
           It is commonly served at celebrations, gatherings, and parties because it is easy to eat and share. 
           The mixture of vegetables and ground pork creates a flavorful inside that contrasts nicely with the crunchy exterior.</p>
        <p>Many Filipino families have their own version of lumpia, using different ingredients depending on taste and availability. 
           This dish encourages creativity, and once wrapped, it can be stored and fried later, making it a convenient snack or side dish anytime.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Follow for Cooking</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a pan with a little oil and sauté garlic and onion for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the ground pork and cook for 5-7 minutes until the meat turns light brown and fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Add grated carrots and cabbage, stir, and cook for another 3-5 minutes until vegetables are softened.</li>
            <li>Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Transfer the filling to a plate and allow it to cool completely—hot filling can tear the wrappers.</li>
            <li>Place a tablespoon of filling on a lumpia wrapper, fold the sides inward, and roll tightly. Seal the end with a little water. Repeat for all wrappers.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan and deep-fry the lumpia on medium heat for 3-5 minutes until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Serve with a sweet chili or vinegar dip.</li>
        </ol>
