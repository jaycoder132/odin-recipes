        <p><strong>Pancit Bihon</strong> is a staple noodle dish in Filipino cuisine, often served during celebrations
           because noodles symbolize long life and good fortune. Made with thin rice noodles stir-fried with meat 
           and vegetables, this dish is both flavorful and filling. It is also commonly served as a snack or full meal 
           at home.</p>
        <p>One of its advantages is its flexibility. Pancit Bihon can include chicken, pork, shrimp, or whatever vegetables 
           are available. It is affordable to make, cooks quickly, and tastes even better when shared, making it a go-to 
           Filipino comfort food.</p>
